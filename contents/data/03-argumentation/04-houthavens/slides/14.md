# Scale 1:200

At a closer scale, transformations of the borderline demonstrate programmatic relations. In the earliest period, warehouses occupied integrally the piers’ width, facilitating wood shipment and unloading—logs would float from the piers to the quays. In the 1950s, canals were filled after the port fell into disuse. Up until the late twentieth century, civil construction companies occupied the warehouses and used the filled canals for parking and circulation. The companies later moved closer to bigger harbors, resulting in the warehouses’ demolition. In the late 2010s, a new process of filling gave room for the construction of multi-level housing blocks. Examples in Wiborgeiland include semi-private terraces, underground garages and living spaces. A second process of excavation brought water closer to the houses and transformed the canals into ground for housing and leisure purposes.
