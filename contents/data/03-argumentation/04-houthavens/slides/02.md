# Scale 1:1000

Excavation and filling processes determined the Houthavens’ configuration overtime. Ground for wood commerce from 1876 to the 1940s, the area was excavated in a comb-like structure—or a sequence of canals and quays. Influenced by transportation and construction advancements, as of the 1950s, the canals were filled and the borderline straightened . In consequence, warehouses built for storage and manufacture of wood were abandoned and later demolished, turning the site into a big empty plot. Due to a residential redevelopment predicted in the Houthavens Master Plan in the 2010s, a second filling was executed, the site’s land area was doubled, and the borderline was outsetted towards the water. Subsequently, new housing blocks were built, and canals were once again excavated in a layout similar to the original timber port situation.
