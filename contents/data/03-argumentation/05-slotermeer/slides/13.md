# Scale 1:200

The transformation of the communal gardens and the playground in the Jan Postmahof from the 1970s to the 2000s evidence the evolution of the types of boundaries on site. The limits around the playground were first defined by trees with wide gaps and wooden benches in between. In the 2000s, an extra layer of low bushes and steel racks significantly increased the enclosure considering the increased use of cars. In 2017, with the trees from the last decade replaced, a concrete bench was constructed and completely enclosed the area. When first constructed, the boundaries between the communal garden and the street were composed of low vegetation. In the 2000s, there was an increase in vegetation in the inner configuration. It was all removed and replaced by metallic, visible fences in the 2017 renovation.
