Since Helmersbuurt’s construction in the late nineteenth century, homeowners have made various interior renovations. These include subdivisions (verkamering), unit combinations, sublevel construction, and design refurbishments. In Derde Helmersstraat 32, the previous homeowner of the first floor purchased the ground floor to combine the two units. This combination maximized living space by creating a split sublevel and adding an additional sleeping room. This converted the ground floor unit from a commercial space to private residential. The following homeowner modified the unit by repainting the exterior, opening the floorplan, and restoring the interior’s ornamental features. Due to these attractive changes, it recently sold for €1.182.000, a record sale for the building. The interior renovations of Helmersbuurt reveal the shifting housing needs for homeowners and tenants. It encapsulates how the neighborhood’s outwardly appearance of preservation is deceptive as the true history of transformation occurs through discreet modifications by private parties.
