# Scale 1:50

The initial proposal included the provision of collective spaces plugged into each residential block, but they remained unrealized. These collective spaces were envisioned as an exterior structure that would extend the internal circulation into nodes of public activities. However, the sunken ground floor space was imagined and reconstructed using fragments of other collective areas within the site and was integrated into the existing structure of the building. At this scale, the maaiveld and the building blocks unify, and the former becomes a surrounding and spill-over to the enclosed public spaces. This imagined scenario presents a condensed image of the possibilities of the threshold between the maaiveld and residential blocks.
