## 4 Terreinsituatie, 1952

Collection City Archives Rotterdam

The _Kampeerterrein Hoek van Holland map_, created in 1953, is part of an archive documenting the planning and development of the campground at _Hoek van Holland_. Drawn on paper and produced by the _Bouw- en Woningtoezicht Rotterdam_ (Building and Housing Inspection), this map was likely used for regulatory and construction oversight. It provides valuable historical information on the layout and intended use of the campground, which was important for managing recreational spaces and ensuring proper development in the area.
