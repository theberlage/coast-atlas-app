## 1 Chromo-topographic Map of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at a Scale of 1:25,000, 478 Hoek van Holland, 1894

Collection National Archives

_The Bonnebladen_ maps were detailed topographical maps created in the 18th and 19th centuries by Dutch cartographer _Jean-Baptiste Bonne_. Produced using triangulation and hand-colored printing, these maps depicted roads, rivers, towns, and elevations. They were essential for both military and civilian use. In 1894, these maps continued to be an important tool for understanding the Netherlands' geography. Today, they are preserved in archives like the _National Archives_ of the Netherlands and are often digitized for research.
