## Installation

*Coast Atlas* is a project that combines both physical and digital outputs, constantly bridging the gap between digital and printed representations.

The Basemap, created using maps from the Documentation, serves as a foundational layer for the research area. This composition was developed with the help of Allmaps, which enabled the georeferencing of the maps. Drawings were posted on the website using georeferencing and annotation techniques. These were all printed in an Atlas, formatted as a Newspaper.
