## Coast Atlas: Argumentation

In Part II, the documentation is developed into arguments that identify architectural and landscape design questions related to territorial developments in the Dutch coastal area, and approaches that have been taken in response. The arguments are depicted through a set of synthetic drawings that articulate the arguments by capturing selected aspects of the found spatial transformation at the scale of the territory and the scale of the space.

From the dunes as untouched land, a protective but unpredictable barrier against the sea, to seawall construction, the relationship between people and the coastal environment changed over the nineteenth century. Focussing on the dunes and the infrastructure built on (dike), below (drinking water system), and through (Nieuwe Waterweg) them, the shifting perception of the dunes from a source of fear to opportunities for exploitation is explored.

This shifting attitude towards the social, cultural and economic value of the coastal landscape is also reflected in the architectural transformation of the coast. Buildings for recreational purposes started appearing. From the eclectic architecture of a state-of-the-art seaside hotel, the Kurhaus in Scheveningen, to linen tents and demountable wooden huts in Hoek van Holland, the spatial transitions address questions of representation through their materiality.

However, the coast was not only approached as a bathing site, but also as a defense line. From standardized bunker design, facilitating the operation of construction of the Atlantikwall, to the burying of obsolete bunkers, the defensive structures profoundly transformed the Dutch coastline. Moreover, it left a complex legacy that intertwined spatial, cultural, and ecological impacts, reflected in the social shift in its use and functions.

The collective outcome is a set of synthetic drawings of the arguments in the scale of 1:100, set up in a military perspective. A uniform architectural language is used to relate them to each other and to enable reflection amongst them. The synthetic drawings are positioned on a collective map at the scale of the territory, depicting the studied section of the South Holland coastline, from Hoek van Holland to Katwijk aan Zee. The collective map is generated by digitally layering fragments from archival maps, creating a historical narrative. The drawings will be digitized and geo-referenced onto this collective map, thus linking the physical and digital, the documentation and the argumentation.
