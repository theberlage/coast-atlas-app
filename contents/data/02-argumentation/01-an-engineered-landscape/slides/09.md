## A Railway Station,

Hoek van Holland station was originally designed as a station for the transport of goods brought by boat via the Hoekse Lijn to Rotterdam and inland. During construction, however, the focus shifted to leisure, which contributed to the development of day tourism from Rotterdam to the coast. This led to the use of the Hoekse Lijn (26) for passenger transport between Hoek van Holland, Schiedam, and later Rotterdam, with passengers from the nearby ferry terminal on the Nieuwe Waterweg also using the train connection to continue their journey. By the 1950s, the station had developed into an international hub (30), offering train connections to destinations outside the Netherlands. 

In addition to the passenger traffic of the Hoekse Lijn, an extra track (29) was laid along the coastline up to Kijkduin in 1906 to transport materials for the reinforcement of the sea wall. During World War II, this track was used to deliver building materials for the bunkers of the Atlantikwall.
