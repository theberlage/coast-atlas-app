## A Shipping Dock.

The construction of the Nieuwe Waterweg in 1872, laid the foundations for the development of Hoek van Holland as a major infrastructure hub. Twenty years after the completion of the canal, plans were made for an extensive network in this strategically located area, including lighthouses, harbour, docks, and station, which would later serve as a vital transport link between the canal and the wider region.

In 1893, the first ferry from Harwich arrived, establishing the area’s role as a major transit hub for passengers travelling between England and the Netherlands. From 1903, the docks were occasionally used for ferries between Rotterdam and the United States. However, after the deepening of the Nieuwe Waterweg in 1932, ships could reach Rotterdam directly, reducing the need for the Hoek van Holland docks for transatlantic traffic. The area was later partly converted for the New Fruit Wharf, which became one of the largest fruit markets in Europe.
