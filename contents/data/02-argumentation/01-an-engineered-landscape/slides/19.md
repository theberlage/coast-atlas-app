## Water Distribution Network,

Meijendel is the largest continuous dune area in South Holland. Constructed in 1874, the open canal was originally designed to transport filtered water across the dunes, running approximately 5,5 kilometers parallel to the coastline. This canal served as the trunk of the early dune water supply system, carrying water from the dunes to pumping stations and, eventually, through the pipe network to urban areas, like The Hague.

In 1903, the surface canal was replaced by a shallow underground network of pipes to improve the efficiency of water distribution, reduce water losses, and minimize the risk of contamination. This underground network, consisting of 0,6 meter diameter pipelines, became the main method of transporting water, allowing for better control of water flow and reducing exposure to environmental factors, such as evaporation. The abandoned  canal was used as a base for the main road network.
