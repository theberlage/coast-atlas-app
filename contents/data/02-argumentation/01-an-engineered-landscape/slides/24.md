## and a Water Filtering System.

Excessive extraction of freshwater caused the contamination between fresh and brackish water,  threatening the groundwater reserves. To solve this, deep wells were introduced in 1915. These wells reached depths of 30 to 50 meters, below the poorly permeable clay layer, tapping into freshwater reserves deep within the dunes. 

A significant change came in 1976 when water from the Afgedamde Maas and the Lek was diverted into the dunes to replenish the groundwater supply and meet the growing urban demand. The pre-purified river water gets transported via two pipelines to the dune area, to recharge the natural freshwater reservoir under the dunes. 

In the 1970s, natural lakes appeared as part of the surface water storage system Along with it came the flora and fauna. This lake served the dual purpose of storing excess water and supporting natural infiltration processes to maintain groundwater levels during dry periods, acting as both a buffer and a natural filter.
