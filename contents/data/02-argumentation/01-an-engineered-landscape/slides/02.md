## A Walking Village,

Situated on a weak part of the coastal dune protection, the village of Ter Heijde has been continuously eroded by the sea over the past centuries. Rebuilt again and again, moving further inland, the village is known as the walking village.

The church remains as a trace of history. First built in 1670, in 53 years it had to be rebuilt 350 meters inland due to coastal erosion, reusing part of the roof structure from the first building. Since then, it has remained in the same location. During World War II, the interior was largely lost as it was used as a horse stable and storage. Only four walls and the roof remained. After the liberation, the church was restored and enlarged, remaining as the only tangible remnant of Heijde's history over the centuries.
