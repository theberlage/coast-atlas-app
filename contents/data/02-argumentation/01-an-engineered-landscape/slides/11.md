## Water Storage Landmarks,

Water towers are crucial for regulating water pressure for urban distribution, also as recognised landmarks and historical monuments along the coastline.

Built in 1893, the water tower in Hoek van Holland distributed filtered water from the dunes to Hoek van Holland and nearby towns, extending the water supply to the corner of South Holland. No longer active, it was 17,6 meters high, constructed mainly of red brick and steel reinforcement. It had a reservoir with 60 cubic meters. Completed in 1886, the water tower in Monster is 37,8 meters high, built of brick and natural stone it supported a reservoir with 600 cubic meters. 

Situated in the Meijendel dunes, the water tower in Scheveningen, built in 1874, served as the first station for transporting filtered dune water to The Hague and nearby towns via a network of underground pipes. Built of brick, natural stone, and steel, a supporting structure for the water tanks weight. It had two reservoirs with 1.000  and 1.200 cubic meters. This tower was the largest one in South Holland.
