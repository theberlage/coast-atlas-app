## A Bathhouse,

The first bathhouse in Scheveningen was built in 1818 by shipowner Jacob Pronk. Initially constructed from wood, it was dismantled during the winter months. However, in 1820, Pronk rebuilt the bathhouse using stone, marking a significant shift from temporality to permanence. This change in material not only enhanced the building but also aimed to attract a larger number of visitors. The bathhouse quickly became a popular destination, primarily visited by the elite class. It featured four rooms, each equipped with a bathtub. Additional services, such as carriages that transported visitors to the sea, further reinforced its exclusive and elitist character. Built from simple, locally sourced materials, the bathhouse was relatively small, and as demand grew, the need for expansion or a new development became apparent.
