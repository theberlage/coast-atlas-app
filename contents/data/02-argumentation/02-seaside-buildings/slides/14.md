## and a Wooden Camp City.

From 1951, a period of economic prosperity started. The amount of paid-leave days rose further to 12, it was the rise of the car. This was reflected in Hoek van Holland. The old campsite was re-established after the war, and a new part was added. From the winter of 1951-1952, it was allowed to stay year-round. The era of tearing down, storing and rebuilding was over.

The quality of the wooden houses improved due to their permanent status, now needing a permit. Because of the new regulations, the designs for the construction plans were professionalized. Carpentry companies, like HAHBO from Rotterdam, started to offer various standardized and prefabricated models, using professional wood, coming from other countries in Europe like Germany or Sweden. In the 1960s the houses were connected to sewerage, water and gas. They also housed more luxurious items such as radios and parasols. What did not change was the people recreating there: working-class families from Rotterdam.
