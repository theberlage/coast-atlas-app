## A Filled-in Anti-tank Ditch,

*Widerstandsnest* 318, located on Badhuisweg, housed German soldiers. This staff was charged with the military command of Scheveningen. The complex consisted of seventeen bunkers but also nearby villas were occupied. 

Constructed in between two villas, an ammunition bunker formed part of the complex. It had  3 meters thick walls and a roof that is 3,5 meters thick. Inside, the bunker was divided into oblong rooms and some smaller rooms, also separated from each other with thick concrete walls. This allowed the different types of ammunition to be stored separately and safely. On the outside of the bunker, fake windows and doors were painted on the concrete. This was to make the bunker look as much like the surrounding villas as possible. Three other ammunition bunkers of the same type FL 246 were built in The Hague. All of them remained after the war, which could be explained by the fact that the immense thickness of the walls of the bunkers made it too costly to demolish them. In 2007 a villa was built on top, named *La DÃ©fense*.
