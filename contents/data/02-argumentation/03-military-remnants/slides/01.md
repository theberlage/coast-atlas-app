## A Rediscovered Shelter, 

The shelters were a representation of a safe haven to military personnel, made completely with fortified concrete and judiciously covered using the existing landscape. The ventilation was insured with pipes circulating the air from over the dunes to the inside of the bunker.

Situated in Batterij V, re-named Battery Vineta by German forces, shelters were built during World War I. Although the country stayed neutral, the fear for the surrounding conflict created the need to build shelters in case of an attack, using the existent dunes as a natural cover. After the war, when the shelters were no longer needed, nature took over and sand covered the bunkers. Yet, during the Interbellum, fear of a new war pushed the decision to reopen the entrance for shelters. In World War II, under the German occupation, the bunkers sheltered German soldiers, in case of an attack from England. During the cold war, the bunkers were reused for other military purposes.
