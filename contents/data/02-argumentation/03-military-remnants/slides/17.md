## and a Built-upon Bunker.

In October 1942, a large part of The Hague and Scheveningen was declared Sperrgebiet, an area made inaccessible to ordinary citizens. The port of Scheveningen made the city of military importance. Therefore, in The Hague defense works were not only built directly along the coast, but also in the middle of the existing urban fabric of the city. A 27 meters wide tank ditch, following the course of the Haagse Beek, zigzagged from Kijkduin to the Gemeentemuseum. In order to construct bunkers and barricades, and clear the fields of fire, about 30.000 houses were demolished and about 50.000 trees in forests and parks were cut down. 

After World War II, the municipality's ambition was to quickly heal the scars in the urban fabric that were created by the war. Architect and urban planner Willem Dudok was appointed to make a plan for the restoration of the ruined parts of the city, hide the scars and make a whole of the area where the former wall and tank trench had run.
