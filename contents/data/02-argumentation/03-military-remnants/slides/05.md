## An Expanded Bunker,

In the Interbellum period, the Dutch army constructed Batterij V, a complex situated in the dune landscape at Hoek van Holland. Including three casematesÂ with artillery guns on top, with a 360 degree field of fire, it was aimed to protect the complex in case of an enemy attack. The Dutch casemate was built with reinforced concrete, with all metallic elements and structures in the interior painted silver.  

In 1943, the Dutch bunker was reshaped by the German forces, and reused as artillery storage when connected to a new German casemate bunker, built following the Regelbau system, with its gun aiming towards England. Several bunkers in the complex were interconnected by covered brick tunnels, and dunes were heightened to cover all structures, modifying the existing landscape. During the Cold War, one of the resembling German casemates was used as foundation for a radar.
