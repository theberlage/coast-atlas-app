## and a Camouflaged Complex.

Strategically located at the Nieuwe Waterweg entry, the Hoek van Holland region was a vital Atlantikwall Festung, a location of the highest importance. An anti-tank ditch, measuring twenty meters wide, three to four meters deep, and eleven kilometers long, separated the Festung from the rest of the country. The existing canals that drained the peatland brought the idea to fill the anti-tank ditch with water, by deepening and deviating them into the newly dug trench.

Along this anti-tank ditch, bunkers were situated to protect the area. Bunkers that were to provide the highest level of protection were constructed with reinforced concrete, or Formsteine blocks when wood was unavailable, while less important structures were made with bricks. Different bunkers were connected through corridors. In a completely flat agricultural land, the bunkers didn't have a natural visual cover to make use of. They were therefore covered with artificial dunes, creating a camouflage to protect against air raids.
