## A Kurhaus.

The Municipal Bathhouse, constructed in 1828 was designed to meet the growing needs of the former bathhouse. The new building featured a central structure complemented by two wings on each side. It offered twelve bathing rooms, thirty rooms, and various other spaces, such as a dining room, billiard room, and a library. 

In 1884, the Kurhaus, was built in just nine months and on the same site as the former Municipal Bathhouse. While a large part of the original structure was demolished, certain sections were preserved and repurposed. It became internationally renowned as a modern bathhouse, distinguished by its large size and enriched amenities. The construction involved the collaboration of the finest craftsmen from across Europe, with materials sourced from a variety of countries. The building's design included a prominent dome, glass arcades, columns, arches, large windows, and a large entrance, and its facade featured yellow stone and marble. Its facilities included dining, billiard, reading, and conversation rooms. Specific shading structures were also introduced at the beach. In 1895, following devastating storms, a concrete seawall was built along Scheveningen beach, with a boulevard on top.
