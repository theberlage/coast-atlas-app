# Extension of the Municipal Bathhouse

In the beginning of the 1850s, the Municipality proceeded with an extension of the Municipal Bathhouse by developing more rooms. They also constructed a boulevard with benches and a pavilion. It was then when the bathhouse was renamed to Grand Hotel des Bains. In 1865, a second extension was made in order for the building to be improved and beautified. A theatre hall was added to the north side and a Kurzaal to the south. It was also offered for entertainment such as theatre, performances, operas and concerts. Hotel Garni opened in 1858 next to the Municipal Bathhouse. In 1884, the Municipal Bathhouse was demolished and the construction of the Kurhaus began.
