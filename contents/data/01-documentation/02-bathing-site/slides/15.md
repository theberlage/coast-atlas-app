# Post-war Hoek van Holland 

The economic prosperity was reflected in Hoek van Holland. The old campsite was re-established, and a new part was added. From the winter of 1951-1952, it was allowed to stay year-round. The wooden houses got professionalised, now needing a permit. What did not change was the people recreating there: working class families from Rotterdam.
