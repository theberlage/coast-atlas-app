# 1937: Plan for enlargement

Because of the crisis in the 1930s, people started to discover the camp site as a cheap place to live, with up to three families living in one wooden house. There was even a stamp post for the unemployed so that they did not have to travel back and forth to Rotterdam.

In 1937, a plan was drawn for the enlargement of the camp with the ‘new camp’. Because of the war, this plan was not implemented.
