# Hoek van Holland

Hoek van Holland emerged from the metamorphosis that Rotterdam had undergone. Until the late nineteenth century, Hoek van Holland was a barren sandbank in the mouth of the river Maas. Around 1860, a settlement arose on the sand, named Oude Hoek, inhabited by workers digging the Nieuwe Waterweg. In 1872, this canal was finished, creating a direct boat connection between the North Sea, Hoek van Holland and Rotterdam. In 1893 a railway was built next to the canal, connecting Schiedam, and later Rotterdam, to the coast. Both the boat and train connection would enable the rise of coastal recreation.

In 1914, the village was added to Rotterdam. In 1921, the municipality took over the exploitation of the Hoekse beach, allowing free camping in the dunes. Because of complaints about indecency, camping was reduced to a restricted area in 1924. Facilities were introduced, such as a water tap, a toilet, police, doctor, and rules.
