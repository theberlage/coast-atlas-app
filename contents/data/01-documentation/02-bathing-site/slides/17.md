# Post-war Scheveningen 

Following an extended period of stagnation, the Industrial Revolution led Amsterdam to a new era of growth. Emerging industries centered around iron, chemicals, and electricity and the introduction of a new traffic network, revitalized trade and the transportation of goods, leading to the economic resurgence of the city in the 20th century. Amsterdam's economic prosperity proved magnetizing inside and outside of the country, resulting consecutively in a significant population growth, effectively doubling it in under five decades. This migrating movement necessitated the development of an expansion plan to accommodate the growing populace. In 1876, after rejecting an ambitious yet costly proposal by J.G. Van Niftrik, J. Kalf, the Director of the Department of Public Works, formulated a more pragmatic and fiscally responsible proposal for the city's expansion.
