# Anti-Tank ditches: Hoek van Holland 

The tank ditch system in Hoek van Holland was part of a series of defensive measures implemented by the German military during World War II to protect the coast from a potential invasion. The system was designed to stop advancing tanks. The anti-tank ditch, a deep trench running through the Festung region, in the peatlands, was filled with water by deviating and deepening the surrounding canals, creating a formidable obstacle. To further secure the strategic point, complexes of bunkers were constructed to reinforce the defensive network, and covered with artificial dunes. Additionally, agricultural lands surrounding the ditch were filled with land mines, further complicating any potential assault.

While the tank ditch itself was primarily a military construction, its presence significantly altered the local landscape. It disrupted the natural environment in a violent way, leaving a legacy of the profound impact of the war on the Dutch landscape.
