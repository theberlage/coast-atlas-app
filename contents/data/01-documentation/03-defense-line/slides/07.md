# Battery V Casemates 

Originally built as a Dutch casemate during the Interbellum, in what is called then called Battery V, out of fear of a German attack, it was later expanded by the Germans during the occupation. The Germans connected the existing Dutch casemate to their own, creating a multilevel fortified structure.
The natural coastal dunes were disrupted by the augmentation of concrete structures, remodelling their natural look and height, altering the ecosystem. The map documents these fortifications reflecting the wartime legacy and its environmental toll on the region, it stands as a testimony to the shift from a free Netherlands to the German occupation, a blend of Dutch and German military design, reflecting the rapid changes within the years.
