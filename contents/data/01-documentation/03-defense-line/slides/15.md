# The Hague

The Germans planned a long tank ditch that would run through the city, stretching from The Hague to Scheveningen. To make way for this military defense line, everything in a hundred meter wide strip was demolished, forcing residents to evacuate their homes and businesses. The area was cleared for the construction of the ditch, which was intended to slow or block any advancing tanks. The tank ditch had a profound impact on both the landscape and the people living in the city. The disruption to daily life was immediate and severe. Entire neighborhoods were uprooted, with families forced to evacuate their homes as the German occupiers cleared a wide path for the defensive trench. The destruction of houses, businesses, and infrastructure left many residents displaced, contributing to a sense of loss and uncertainty.
