# Spanaardsduin to Battery Vineta 

Formerly called Spanjaardsduin during the First World War I and earlier, Batterij V during the Interbellum, the complex adopted the name Battery Vineta during the German regime. The Battery played a crucial role, due to its location in the dune landscape, in defending the entrance to the Nieuwe Waterweg and Rotterdam Harbor. Throughout its military function, the site included dutch shelter bunkers, then expanded with casemates, artillery bunkers, shelters, workstations, munition storages, sleeping bunkers, , _tobroeks_, commander post, radar, and many others. When peace was restored, the Vineta name remained, with some bunkers maintaining functions, others being demolished, and some repurposed for emergency housing.

The map is created after World War II, and is part of the Dutch effort which tracks and documents the remnants of the _Atlantikwall_ to gain a better understanding of its structure and impact. The map documents both German and Dutch bunkers in a symbolic manner, though multiple inconsistencies are evident.
