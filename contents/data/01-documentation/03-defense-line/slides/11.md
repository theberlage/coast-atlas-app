# The Anti-Tank Ditch System 

The tank ditch system in Hoek van Holland was a key defensive feature constructed by the German military during World War II as part of the Atlantikwall. Designed to slow down or block advancing tanks and infantry, the ditch was dug three to four meters deep, and up to twenty meters wide. German forces, including soldiers and forced laborers, worked to carve the trench through the flat peatlands. The ditch was reinforced with steep edges, anti-tank obstacles, and was complemented by bunkers, tunnels and gun emplacements along its length.

The German map details the bunkers and the relating functions, and their geographical position to anti-tank ditch. Though it was never tested in battle. After the war, much of the ditch was filled in during post-war redevelopment due to the drastic agricultural need, but its remnants still stand as a reminder of the wartime fortifications.
