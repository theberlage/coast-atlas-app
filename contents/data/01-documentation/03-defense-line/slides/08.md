# Battery Vineta, A Tunnel Network

The German map of  World War II reveals Battery Vineta as part of _Stutzpunkt III_, with a detailed network of tunnels and fortifications. While the Dutch maps primarily focus on coastal defense positions and bunker structures, the German map symbolises the typology of bunkers with symbols and highlights the extensive underground infrastructure, including tunnels interconnecting all the complex, designed for troop movements, ammunition storage, and protection from air raids.

These tunnels, made by bricks and inclined walls, were crucial for the Germans to reinforce their defense and maintain operations under cover, camouflaged by the modified dunes, showcasing the significant military upgrades made to the site. This difference underscores the dramatic shift in defensive strategies and the scale of German fortification efforts for the _Atlantikwall_.
