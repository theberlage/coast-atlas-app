# The Dutch Documentation

The Dutch map analyzes remnants of German military structures, documenting their varied construction methods. High-priority bunkers were built with poured concrete for durability and safety, while _Formsteine_ concrete blocks were used when wood was scarce. Less important structures, like certain bunkers and tunnels, were made of bricks.

Brick-built bunkers and tunnels were easily demolished after the war, leaving fewer traces. However, the poured concrete bunkers proved far more resilient. Many of these still exist, either artificially covered or repurposed as foundations for housing. This enduring presence serves as a testament to the wartime ingenuity and priorities in defensive construction, as well as the ongoing effect of landscape of the area. The map stands as a critical record of these structures and their legacy in the Dutch territory.
