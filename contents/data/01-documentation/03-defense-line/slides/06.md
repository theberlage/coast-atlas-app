# Spanaardsduin’s Shelter Bunker

The shelters in Spanjaardsduin, constructed with fortified concrete and cleverly camouflaged by the dunes, were ventilated using pipes that circulated air from over the dunes into the bunkers. Built during World War I, despite the Netherlands’ neutrality, they addressed fears of a potential attack. After the first war ended, sand gradually reclaimed the bunkers, concealing them.

During the Interbellum, the rising threat of conflict led to their re-opening. Under German occupation in World War II, the shelters housed soldiers, preparing for potential attacks from England, reflecting the evolving needs of the times. These structures demonstrate how structures and natural landscapes intertwined across decades of shifting military standpoints.
