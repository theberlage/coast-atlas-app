# The Cold War

The Dutch map, made by Ministry Van Marine,  of Battery Vineta provides a detailed representation of the defensive structures that were repurposed for the post-war era, and the absence of others forgotten or deemed unimportant.

After World War II, the strategic location of Battery Vineta, with its coastal position, made it a key site for military defense during the Cold War, particularly against potential threats from the Soviet Union. The map shows the network of bunkers, many of which had been initially constructed during the German occupation, now adapted with new military technologies and functions. These included reinforced shelters, radar stations, and communication centers, all part of a broader network of Cold War defenses.
