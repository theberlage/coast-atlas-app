# The Hague

The physical landscape of The Hague was also drastically altered. The cityâ€™s familiar urban fabric was broken up, with large swaths of land cleared for military purposes, leaving vacant spaces and altered views. The tank ditch itself, a deep trench carved through the city, became an imposing reminder of wartime occupation and military strategy. For the people of The Hague, the experience was a painful one, marked by both personal and collective hardship. The loss of homes and livelihoods, coupled with the psychological toll of wartime occupation, left a lasting scar. However, in the aftermath of the war, the efforts to restore and rebuild the city began to heal some of these wounds.
