# Plan Dudok

The Plan Dudok was part of a broader post-war approach to urban reconstruction in the Netherlands, focusing on rebuilding cities devastated by World War II. In the aftermath of the war, the Netherlands faced widespread destruction, housing shortages, and economic challenges. The Dutch government and urban planners prioritized rebuilding efforts to create modern, functional cities that could accommodate growing populations and provide better living conditions.

Willem Dudok's plan for The Hague was a key part of this effort. It emphasized modernist architecture, efficient use of space, and the integration of green areas to improve the quality of urban life. The post-war approach in the Netherlands aimed to not only repair physical damage but also reshape urban environments to meet the needs of a changing society. This included expanding residential areas, improving transportation networks, and creating public spaces that encouraged community interaction.
