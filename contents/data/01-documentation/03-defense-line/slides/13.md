# Military Importance

The _Atlantikwall_ was a vast coastal defense system constructed by Nazi Germany during World War II to protect occupied territories from invasions. Stretching across the European coastline, it consisted of diverse, complex structures, each serving unique strategic purposes. Battery Vineta, a key site, played a vital role from World War I through the Cold War and the anti-tank complex, extensively multiplied. Their prominence is highlighted by its significant use of materials and the aggressive transformation of the surrounding landscape.

A single red circle on the map represents one complex, symbolizing the immense effort and workforce invested along the Dutch coastline. The remains of the _Atlantikwall_, serve as stark reminders of the massive scale of wartime fortifications and their enduring impact on the landscape.
