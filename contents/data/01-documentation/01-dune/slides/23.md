# Lakes with Growing Environmental Concerns

After 1955, significant changes were made in water extraction practices to address growing environmental concerns. The depletion of groundwater in the dunes, caused by excessive water extraction, had led to a drastic lowering of the water table. This caused the drying out of wet dune slacks, a critical habitat that once covered about a third of the dune areas and was of high ecological value. Additionally, water pumped from deep wells had turned brackish, necessitating a new approach to ensure water supply and maintain ecological balance.

The infrastructure hence became more sophisticated, with the introduction of surface water infiltration methods. Lakes appear on the surface of Dune. This process helped restore groundwater levels, ensuring a more sustainable extraction system.
