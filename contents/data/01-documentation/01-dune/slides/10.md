# Blood Mountain: Landscaping the Dunes

Right next to Ter Heijdean ambitious landscaping project aimed to approach the dunes in an unconventional way. During the 1930s crisis years, there were many unemployed in the village of Monster and as part of the werkverschaffing, the mayor came up with the idea of planting trees on a Delfland-owned dune area and creating a nature park. 

Sand from the wider area was gathered and brought to this place with wheelbarrows by the unemployed. This created a "mountain" of about eleven meters in height. Trees were planted, but the proximity to the sea and the sandy soil was a danger to their growth. Raising the viewing platform was a very hard job, which is why the hill was named the Blood Mountain. During World War II, the forest was completely destroyed and to this day, only the lookout hill remains visible from the ambitious landscaping project.
