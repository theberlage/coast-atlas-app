# Blood Mountain, Landscaping the Dunes

Right next to Ter Heijde, instead of moving further inland, an ambitious landscaping project aimed to approach the dunes in a new way. During the crisis years of 1935-1930, many in Monster were unemployed due to the poor cultivation of grapes. In response, the mayor proposed the idea of planting trees on a Delfland-owned dune area to create a nature park. 

Sand from the wider area was gathered and brought to this location with wheelbarrows, creating a "mountain" about 11 meters high. Trees were planned, but the proximity to the sea and the sandy soil posed challenges to crop growth. The difficult task of raising the viewing platform led to the hill being named "Blood Mountain." 

During World War II, the forest was completely destroyed, and today, only the lookout hill remains as a visible reminder of the ambitious landscaping project.
