# Hoek van Holland station

Hoek van Holland station was established during the construction of the Hoekse Lijn, serving as a place for storing goods transported between the railway and the Nieuwe Waterweg. The station underwent multiple expansions, coinciding with the development of the Hoek van Holland harbor, the tram line, and the Strandlijn.
