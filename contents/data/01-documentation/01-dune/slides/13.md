# Westlandsche Stoomtramweg Maatschappij

In 1897, the idea arose to develop the ports of Hoek van Holland and Scheveningen and connect them via a railway. This would allow for the easy transport of goods and, eventually, people between the two ports. However, the plan for the railway between Scheveningen and Hoek van Holland was never fully realized. 

In 1905, a tram line to Hoek van Holland was constructed from Loosduin and Monster, with the primary goal of transporting people. The tram line was also used to transport locally produced vegetables and fruits to the port.
