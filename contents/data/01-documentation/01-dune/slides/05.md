# Hoekse Lijn

The railway line from Schiedam to Hoek van Holland, established in 1893, was built as a result of the development of the Nieuwe Waterweg. It was originally constructed for transporting goods between the harbors, but over time it was adapted for passenger use as well, becoming a vital link between Rotterdam and the coast. 

The railway is built on specially constructed dikes, therefore it also functions as an additional protection against floods.
