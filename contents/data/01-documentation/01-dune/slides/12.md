# Hoek Van Holland 1938

As time passed, the temporary settlements transitioned into a permanent village, featuring a school and a church. With the construction of the Hoekse Line and the expansion of the Port of Hoek van Holland, development began to shift inland. This change was driven by a growing demand for housing and infrastructure as more workers and their families moved into the area. Over the years, this inland expansion shaped what is now the center of Hoek van Holland.
