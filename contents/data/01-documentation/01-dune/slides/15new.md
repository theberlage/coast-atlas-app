# The Dune Village

Surrounded by dunes on three sides and wedged between the Verversingskanaal, the dune park Bosjes van Poot, the Westduinpark, and the North Sea, Duindorp was originally a fishing village with small houses near the port, in an area that was still largely undeveloped dune land. 

The first housing complexes were built in 1916-1917, making them some of the earliest municipal Housing Act homes in The Hague. Some residents came from the redeveloped Scheveningen slums during this period. The section around Pluvierstraat was then constructed between 1920 and 1930. 

During World War II, Duindorp was uninhabited as it became part of the Atlantic Wall, forcing all residents to leave. After the war, it was temporarily used as an internment area for ex-NSB (National Socialist Movement) members before undergoing significant reconstruction. Only after 1951 were the original residents able to return to their district.
