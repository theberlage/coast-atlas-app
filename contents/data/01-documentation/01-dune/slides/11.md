# Hoek Van Holland 1880

Before the excavation of the Nieuwe Waterweg, the village of Hoek van Holland did not exist. The first building constructed in the area was the administrative office of the Rijkswaterstaat in 1867, which served as the headquarters for the excavation work on the Nieuwe Waterweg. Around this office, workers involved in the project began to settle, forming the first settlement, known as De Oude Hoek.
