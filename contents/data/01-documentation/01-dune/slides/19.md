# Water Towers on the Dune

This appropriation began in 1874 with the construction of the first water tower in Scheveningen, a turning point that formalized the use of dunes as a resource. Following this, the Watertoren Katwijk (1878), the Watertoren Monster (1886), and the Watertoren Hoek van Holland (1894) were built to expand water supply infrastructure.

Water towers have been a characteristic part of the built environment in the Netherlands. Between 1856 and the early 20th century, more than 260 towers were constructed for the centralized water supply system. Structurally, water towers were typically built with robust materials like brick, concrete, and steel to support large water tanks, ensuring durability and stability. Architecturally, many were designed in eclectic styles, combining functional engineering with decorative elements. The towersâ€™ cylindrical or polygonal shapes reflected the need for both water storage and pressure regulation, with tanks elevated to maintain sufficient water pressure for urban distribution.
