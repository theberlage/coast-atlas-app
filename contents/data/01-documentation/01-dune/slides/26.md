# Environmental Concerns

After 1955, significant changes were made in water extraction practices to address growing environmental concerns. The depletion of groundwater in the dunes, caused by excessive water extraction, had led to a drastic lowering of the ground water level. This caused the dessicating of wet dune slacks, a critical habitat that once covered about a third of the dune areas and was of high ecological value. Additionally, water pumped from deep wells had turned brackish, necessitating a new approach to ensure water supply and maintain ecological balance.

The infrastructure became increasingly sophisticated with the introduction of surface water infiltration methods, marking a turning point in sustainable water management. Lakes began to appear on the surface of the dunes as this process helped restore groundwater levels, creating a more sustainable system for water extraction.
