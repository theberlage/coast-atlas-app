# Open Canals

Long, open canals were dug in 1874, running parallel to the coastline, to collect groundwater, and to transport water to nearby pumping stations. A main artery with side branches A to M was dug in the dune area. It was divided into five sections, of unequal lengths, by dams, equipped with culverts, of which the lower section reached to the Harstenhoek

The course of this canal was chosen in such a way that it followed the lowest parts of the dune and was good to soil storage at the same time.
