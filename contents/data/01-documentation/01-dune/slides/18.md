# Water Towers

Extracting water from the dunes required the construction of a large complex to facilitate the process. This included essential infrastructure such as a water tower, pump station, canals, and large sedimentation reservoirs. The pump station was powered by steam, necessitating a separate building to house the boilers, as well as another structure to store the coal that fuelled them.

Water towers have long been a distinctive feature of the Dutch landscape. Between 1856 and the early twentieth century, more than 260 towers were constructed as part of the centralized water supply system. The first water tower built in the dunes was located in Scheveningen. Designed in the Eclectic style by architect Bert Brouwer and civil engineer Theodor Stang, it was constructed in 1874 by the  Duinwaterleidingbedrijf. Standing as the largest in South Holland, this tower represents a significant advancement in both water management and architectural design.
