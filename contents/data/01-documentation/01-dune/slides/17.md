# Appropriating the Dunes

The largest source of drinking water in the Netherlands is groundwater (over 60%). Near the dune areas in South Holland, the main production systems are water extraction from the dunes, surface water reservoirs near the rivers Rhine and Meuse and scattered ground water recoveries.

Dune landscapes are appropriated into an essential source of drinking water, with ambitious design proposals in the 1860s. The light blue line on historical maps marks the initial design proposal, which planned to direct dune water to multiple cities, including The Hague, Leiden, Delft, and Rotterdam. However, The Hagueâ€™s government opposed this plan, preferring to keep its dune water supply local. This led to a revised project, shown in dark blue on the map, with construction starting in 1874 with the first water tower in Scheveningen. This tower marked a significant turning point, formalizing the dunes' role as a drinking water source. 

Subsequently, the infrastructure expanded with the construction of additional water towers in Katwijk (1878), Monster (1886), and Hoek van Holland (1894). These towers and their associated canals and pipelines formed an increasingly intricate system that delivered water to surrounding cities.
