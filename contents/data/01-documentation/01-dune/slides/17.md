# Appropriating the Dunes

The largest source of drinking water in the Netherlands is groundwater (over 60%). Near the dune areas in South Holland, the main production systems are water extraction from the dunes, surface water reservoirs near the rivers Rhine and Meuse and scattered ground water recoveries.

Dune landscapes are appropriated into an essential source of drinking water. This transformation begins in 1874 with the construction of the first water tower in Scheveningen, a turning point that formalized the use of dunes as a resource. Following this, the Watertoren Katwijk (1878), the Watertoren Monster (1886), and the Watertoren Hoek van Holland (1894) were built to expand the water supply infrastructure.
