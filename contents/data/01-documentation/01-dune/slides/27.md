# Water from the Rivers 

In 1955, the plan to filter water from the Rhine (specifically the Lek) through the dune sand finally became a reality after years of delay, including setbacks from  World War II. By the 1970s, river water from the Rhine and Meuse was regularly infiltrated into the dunes, further replenishing freshwater supplies that had been overexploited in previous decades. This strategy helped stabilizing groundwater levels while supporting both water extraction and environmental sustainability.

Water companies soon merged to centralize operations, improving efficiency and control over resources. By the 1990s, companies like Dunea began managing much of South Hollandâ€™s water supply, balancing extraction with ecological preservation to protect the integrity of the dune landscapes.
