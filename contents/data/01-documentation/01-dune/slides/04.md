# Idea of the Nieuwe Waterweg

The excavation of the Nieuwe Waterweg was launched as part of a larger infrastructure plan to expand the Port of Rotterdam and improve maritime access. This new waterway provided a direct and more efficient route for ships traveling between Rotterdam and the North Sea at Hoek van Holland. 

The project was conceived by civil engineer Pieter Caland, who proposed cutting a straight canal through the dunes and marshlands at Hoek van Holland. This design greatly shortened and deepened the shipping channel, ensuring smoother and faster passage for vessels, and transforming Rotterdam into a key European port.
