# The Nieuwe Waterweg 

The Nieuwe Waterweg became operational in 1872 with an initial depth of only 4.5 meters. Over the years, it has been upgraded and expanded multiple times to accommodate the growing Port of Rotterdam and the increasing size of cargo ships.

The excavation of the Nieuwe Waterweg also caused the area of De Beer, near Hoek van Holland, to become separated from the mainland, turning it into an isolated nature reserve. In the 1950s, De Beer was completely destroyed by the expansion of Rotterdam harbor. Nature was replaced by harsh infrastructure.
