# Development of Scheveningen

Scheveningen and The Hague were separated from each other for centuries by what was called 's Graven Wildernisse, a large, difficult to navigate dune area. Even when  Scheveningseweg was constructed in 1665, Scheveningen remained small. Around 1800 Scheveningen began to grow when simple fishermen's cottages appeared on the south-eastern side. In the meantime, a seaside resort called the Kurhaus developed next to the fishing village. From the 1875s, The Hague began to grow towards Scheveningen.

In Keizerstraat, houses were built on a former dune area with large differences in height. As some were below street level, these houses were very damp and the region had become a large labyrinth of alleys and slums. In 1888, the Verversingskanaal was built with the aim of draining polluted water from the city to the sea. Since the expansion of the Port of Scheveningen  in 1930, the canal has been connected to the inner harbor.
