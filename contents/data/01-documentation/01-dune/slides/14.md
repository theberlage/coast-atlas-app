# Development of Scheveningen

Scheveningen and The Hague were separated for centuries by what was called 's Graven Wildernisse, a large, difficult-to-navigate dune area with only a few footpaths and cart tracks. Even with the construction of the Scheveningseweg in 1665, Scheveningen remained small in size. 

It wasnâ€™t until after 1800 that Scheveningen began to grow, with simple fishermen's cottages appearing on the southeastern side. At the same time, a seaside resort began to develop next to the fishing village. 

By the third quarter of the nineteenth century, both sides of Keizerstraat had turned into a labyrinth of alleys, slums, and courtyards. The separation between the poor fishing village and the upscale seaside resort was stark. In 1901, the Housing Act was passed with the primary goal of "promoting public health by improving housing conditions." Around 1916, the first housing complexes were built in Duindorp.
