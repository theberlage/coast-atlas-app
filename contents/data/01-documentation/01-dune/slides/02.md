# Coastal protection

Part of the coastal protection of the Netherlands, wavebreakers can be found along the entire Dutch coast, arranged at equal distances and numbered in sequence. These structures consist of wooden poles on a dam of stones and basalt blocks, helping to regulate the water flow around port entrances, protect ships from waves, and prevent the dune landscape from being eroded by storms. 

In the Netherlands, rockfall breakwaters are most commonly used. These breakwaters are often located at great depths underwater and consist of chunks of rubble surrounded by a layer of heavy rocks, the so-called "armour" layer.
