# Shift to Underground Pipelines and Deep Wells

By 1903, the demand for drinking water had increased significantly, requiring the water extraction infrastructure to adapt. Water levels had dropped due to excessive extraction, prompting engineers to move away from surface canals, with only sections near the factory continuing to use them. The construction of test pits and cement pits began, some following old canal routes, while others were scattered throughout the dunes. This period marked the shift toward underground pipelines replacing open canals.

After World War II, from 1930 to 1955, the mechanization of water extraction reached new heights. Deep wells were introduced to access water reserves at depths of 30 to 50 meters below sea level, and an intricate pipe network spread across the dunes. The process became increasingly industrialized, marking a shift toward modern water extraction techniques that continue to shape the water infrastructure today.
