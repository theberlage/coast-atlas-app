# Test Pits and Cement Reservoirs

The early open canal system, while functional, would soon prove insufficient as urban populations grew. Canals were dug deeper, longer, and wider. By the early twentieth century, the groundwater levels began to drop, and a shift to more advanced water extraction methods became necessary. 

Test pits and cement reservoirs were introduced, with some following the original canal routes and others scattered throughout the dunes. The system evolved further with the advent of underground pipelines, a significant innovation that reduced the reliance on open surface canals and shifted much of the water extraction process underground.
