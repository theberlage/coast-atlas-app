# The Dune Village

Surrounded by dunes on 3 sides and wedged between the Verversingskanaal, park Bosjes van Poot and Westduinpark, Duindorp district was first a fishing village, with small houses near the port, in an area that was still largely undeveloped dune land. In 1901, the Housing Act was passed, the main goal of which was: "to promote public health by improving housing conditions". It would take until 1914 before they started the redevelopment. Duindorp district is among the earliest municipal housing act homes in The Hague, as the first housing complexes were built in 1916.

Some of the residents came from the Scheveningen slums that were redeveloped during this period. Duindorp was uninhabited during the war years, it was part of the Atlantikwall and all residents had to leave. Only after 1951 were the original residents able to return to their district.
