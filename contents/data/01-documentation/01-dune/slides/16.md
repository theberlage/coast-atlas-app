# Appropriating Dune Landscapes for Drinking Water

The largest source of drinking water in the Netherlands is groundwater (over 60%). Near the dune areas in North and South Holland, the main production systems are water extraction from the dunes, surface water reservoirs near the rivers Rhine and Meuse and scattered ground water recoveries.

Dune landscapes are transformed into an essential source of drinking water. It begins in 1874 with the construction of the first water tower, a turning point that formalized the use of dunes as a resource. Before this, dunes were understood as natural filtration systems: rainwater would seep through the sandy soil, creating underground reservoirs of fresh water. Long, open canals were dug, running parallel to the coastline, to transport water to nearby pumping stations. This early system, while functional, would soon prove insufficient as urban populations grew.
