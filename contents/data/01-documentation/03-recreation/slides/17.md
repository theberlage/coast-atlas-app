# Scheveningen after WWII

Scheveningen was among the most severely damaged Dutch seaside resorts. The reconstruction created a larger-scale, efficient traffic structure with permanent elements such as a car boulevard, hotels, restaurants and apartment complexes. The pre-war cast iron pier, which had been demolished in 1943 due to the Atlantik Wall, was not reconstructed until 1970. The new pier was designed as a concrete megastructure with several platforms. After the war, instead of an elite seaside resort, Scheveningen became a recreation location for the masses.
