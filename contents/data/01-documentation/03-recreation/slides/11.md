# Exploitation Ordinance

From 1930, shopkeepers had to submit a request for an exploitation ordinance of their shops at the beach strip for the time frame from 1931-1939. These requests consisted of a handwritten letter to the municipality combined with drawings and pictures of their requested shops. The municipality would make a selection, and draw a section with the assigned plots along the beach.
