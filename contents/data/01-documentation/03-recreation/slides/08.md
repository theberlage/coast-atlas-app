# Nineteenth century growth Rotterdam

Until the nineteenth century, the city of Rotterdam was a small town, an area of 140 hectares between the city walls. At the end of the nineteenth century, Rotterdam started growing immensely. From 160,000 inhabitants in 1880, it rose to 315,000 inhabitants in 1900. Because of the industrial revolution, a massive migration of people from the countryside in Brabant to Rotterdam took place, looking for work in the harbor and factories. There was a lot of poverty, unemployment and a lack of housing. People were paid low wages, had long working days and lived with complete families in a one-room house. 

After World War I, the Labour Law was enforced, which made an eight-hour working day and a free Saturday afternoon mandatory. During the 1920s, an economic revival took place, tents and bicycles became cheaper, the beaches in the whole country were democratized, and the working class from Rotterdam started to look for a place for recreation: the beach of Hoek van Holland.
