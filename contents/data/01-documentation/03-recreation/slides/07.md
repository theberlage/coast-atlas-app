# Infrastructure Developments

By the end of the nineteenth century, a steam tram and an electric tram lines were developed connecting  the coast with Den Haag. Around 1900, plans were made for a second railway line from Rotterdam to The Hague and Scheveningen. It was then that a railway was developed, the famous ‘Hofpleinlijntje’ which connected Scheveningen with Rotterdam, via Den Haag. The opening of the first section, Den Haag Hollands Spoor - Scheveningen, took place in 1907. The second section, Den Haag Hollands Spoor - Rotterdam Hofplein, was opened in 1908. The railway also connected Scheveningen to Amsterdam.

In the 1920s, the Kurhaus was the international centre of seaside recreation for the elite, a gathering point for international princes and statesmen. However, the infrastructure developments also enabled the democratisation of the beach. Working class families from the big cities started using the beach for recreation too, which is especially well presented in the city of Rotterdam.
