# The First Bathhouse

In 1818, Jacob Pronk, a shipowner from Scheveningen, built a small wooden bathhouse by the sea, a 10-minute walk from the village of Scheveningen, marking the start of Dutch coastal recreation. The wooden building was dismantled every winter and had one reception room and four rooms, each with a bathtub. Additionally, it had two bathing carriages to take guests into the sea. In 1820, with municipal subsidies, Pronk replaced the wooden building with a stone one. During this period, the bathhouse was accessed by a road that was built from the Wassenaarsestraat to the bathing facility, today Gevers Deijnootweg. Scheveningseweg was constructed in 1665 and played an important role for the development of the bathhouse. Apart from wealthy Dutch visitors, the bathhouse attracted foreigners as well.
