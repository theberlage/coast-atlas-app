# The Kurhaus in Scheveningen

The municipality wanted to further enhance the international, elitarian allure of Scheveningen. Therefore, they asked the German architects Johan Henkenhaf and Friedrich Ebert to design a new Kurhaus, built on the site of the Municipal Bathhouse. The central part of the building was a square crowned by a colossal dome, stylistically inspired by the Italian renaissance combined with elements from the Dutch renaissance, made to impress. It was constructed in only nine months and produced in six different countries by the best local craftsmen. A wide veranda, partly enclosed with glass, extended along the seaside. It contained a restaurant, billiard room, and a reading room. 

A year after it was built, it was destroyed by a fire. In 1886, the second Kurhaus was rebuilt and underwent some changes. Various hotels around it were built as well. In 1901 the pier was constructed.
