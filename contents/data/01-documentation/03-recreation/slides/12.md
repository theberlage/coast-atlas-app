# The Dutch Coast during WWII

During WWII, the construction of the Atlantik Wall meant a large-scale demolition of the Dutch coastal area. Meanwhile, in 1940, the amount of paid-leave days rose to 6, giving the inhabitants more time to recreate, but the beach and the dunes had become a no-go zone. The beach was blocked off with wood and concrete and bunkers were built along the entire coast. 

As part of the Atlantik wall, a tank ditch was dug through the campsite in Hoek van Holland. Also the Kurhaus was severely damaged. Part of the Kurhaus terrace was demolished to make space for a tank ditch. The boulevard with stairs and exits was destroyed and the pier was also demolished. The six tram lines and the connection with Scheveningen were partly dismantled.
