# The Municipal Bathhouse

Soon, the Bathhouse of Pronk was considered too simple. The municipality wanted to make Scheveningen a seaside resort with international, high-class allure. The Municipality bought the bathhouse and demolished it. In 1828, a Municipal Bathhouse was built, which consisted of twelve bathing facilities and thirty rooms. It was a building with a central part and two wings. It also featured a library, a reception room, a dining room and a billiard room. The architect was the city architect Zeger Revers who based his design on the model of the bathhouse in Aachen.
