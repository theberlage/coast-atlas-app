# The Access to the Coast

In 1850, the Badhuisweg was constructed, connecting the Municipal Bathhouse directly to Den Haag. The visitors of the Municipal Bathhouse were mainly aristocrats from Den Haag and wealthy foreigners. Diverse social classes gathered in Scheveningen to enjoy the sea. Foreigners and wealthy people of the Hague visited the Municipal bathhouse, while middle class people went to Bathhouse Zeerust, near the village of Scheveningen. Workers and the poor used a cheap bathing facility, near the lighthouse, as far away from the other bathers as possible.
