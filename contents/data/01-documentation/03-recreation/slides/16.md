# Construction Plan

Because of the new regulations, the designs for the construction plans of the wooden houses were professionalised. Carpentry companies started to offer various standardized and prefab models. HAHBO was such a company from Rotterdam. However, in Hoek van Holland, most of the houses continued to be designed by the owners themselves, representing the owners personal identity through the materiality.
