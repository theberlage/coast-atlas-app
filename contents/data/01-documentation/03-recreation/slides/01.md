# Dutch Coastal Recreation

Until the eighteenth century, the sea was considered a dangerous site. Over the century, this started to change. Along the coasts of the North Sea, the medicinal properties of sea and beach were discovered by the elite. With the first bathhouse constructed in Scheveningen in 1818, seaside recreation as a form of healthcare and leisure for the upper class had reached the Netherlands, and widely expanded in the second half of the nineteenth century. With the opening of the first campsite in Hoek van Holland in 1924, coastal leisure for the working class - which grew with the enforcement of the Labour Law - was given form. After World War II, seaside recreation grew exponentially, marking the start of mass tourism. 

Through maps, the rise of different forms of Dutch coastal recreation and their materiality are studied, representing the transitions in Dutch society from the nineteenth century until the post-war period.
