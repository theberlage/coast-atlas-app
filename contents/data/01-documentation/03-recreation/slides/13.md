# Recreation and Planning after WWII

The Dutch coast was badly damaged by the war. During the reconstruction period, there was a revival of Dutch seaside towns. In order to coordinate the reconstruction of the coastal towns, the National Office for National Planning, which was established in 1941, published a booklet entitled ‘Considerations concerning the reconstruction of Northsea seaside towns’ in 1947. This discussed the character of the various seaside towns and the importance of differentiation between them. The report was not received well, and the attempt for coordination between the seaside towns failed, but it represented a change in mentality: outdoor recreation was no longer seen as a luxury, but as a need/right. 

From 1951 a period of economic prosperity started. The amount of paid-leave days rose further to 12, it was the rise of the car, the start of mass-tourism. It meant an unprecedented crowdedness of the Dutch coast with visitors from the Netherlands and abroad.
