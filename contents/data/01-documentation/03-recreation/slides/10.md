# 1930s: Wooden Camp City

In their daily newspaper Voorwaarts, the workers were explained how to build a tent. The ‘Workers' tourism' page showed wooden skeletons, covered with a piece of cotton. A mixture of soap and iron sulphate were used with the intention on making the tent canvas waterproof. Soon the first wooden houses started to appear at the camp. They were simple, proudly built by the workers themselves, often made from driftwood. Later, carpentry companies started to produce standard models. They were positioned along straight roads, and a shopping street was added as well. It began to look like an ordinary seaside settlement, but it was a summer village. Everything had to be demolished and removed in winter. 

The camp became extremely popular in the 1930s, with 4000 overnight stays in 1933. Whether they slept under thin and transparent linen or wood, the residents remained the same: working class families from Rotterdam, looking for relaxation. The enormous growth led to a call for spatial planning, such as the exploitation ordinance for the shops.
