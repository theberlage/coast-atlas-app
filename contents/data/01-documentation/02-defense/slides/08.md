# Bunker Wn 270 

Bunker Wn270 is a German World War II command post located in Hoek van Holland, primarily used to support coastal artillery operations. Constructed from thick reinforced concrete, it offered protection against aerial bombardments and artillery strikes. This bunker had communication facilities to coordinate military activities, allowing personnel to plan artillery engagements effectively. It was demolished in 1948.
