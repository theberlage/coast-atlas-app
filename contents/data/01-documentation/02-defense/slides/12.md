# Regelbau 634

The Regelbau 634 is a German air raid shelter constructed during World War II, designed to protect against aerial attacks. Characterized by its reinforced concrete structure, it offers significant protection against explosions and shrapnel. The bunker typically accommodates a small group of people, featuring basic amenities. Regelbau 634 bunkers were strategically placed in urban environments, ensuring that civilians had access to shelter during bombings. This type of bunker is part of the standardized Regelbau system, ensuring consistent construction across various military and civilian shelters. The bunker was demolished in 1945.
