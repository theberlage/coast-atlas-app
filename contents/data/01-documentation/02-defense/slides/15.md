# Freie kuste

Complex D is an example of a smaller battery in the village of Monster. Situated between Scheveningen and Hoek van Holland. This area was called ‘Freie Kuste’ by the German army because of the lack of military importance. The battery consists of 11 Accommodation bunkers, 7 storage bunkers, 3 tobrouks and 2 canon casemath. Contrary to the bigger Batteries, bunkers were built in concrete and brickwork. 

The high dunes played to the Germans' advantage. They provided water extraction channels that acted as natural tank ditches.
