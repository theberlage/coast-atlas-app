# Batteries: Hoek van Holland 

Hoek van Holland played a crucial role in the Atlantic Wall as a strategic coastal defence point in the Netherlands. Located at the entrance to the Nieuwe Waterweg, it was vital for controlling maritime traffic and protecting one of Germany's key logistical hubs. The area was fortified with a series of bunkers, gun emplacements, and anti-landing, mines, trenches obstacles designed to deter invasions.
