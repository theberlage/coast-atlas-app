# Tobroek

The name is derived from the city of Tobruk in Libya, where these bunkers were first constructed. The Germans later adopted the design, and thousands were built along the Atlantic Wall​. Typically, a Tobruk bunker features an eight-sided or round opening on the top for machine gun fire, serving as a fortified combat position or observation post. Its dimensions are roughly 3.7 meters long, 2.4 meters wide, and 2.75 meters deep.
