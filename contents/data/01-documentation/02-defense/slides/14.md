# Tobroek

The bunker’s origin lies in the city of Tobruk in Libya, where they were first constructed. The Germans later adopted the design, and thousands were built along the Atlantikwall​. Typically, a Tobruk bunker features an eight-sided or round opening on the top for machine gun fire, serving as a fortified combat position or observation post. Its dimensions are roughly 3.7 meters long, 2.4 meters wide, and 2.75 meters deep.
