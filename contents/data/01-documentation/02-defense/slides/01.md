# The Atlantikwall

The Atlantikwall was a defence line built by Nazi Germany during World War II, stretching along the western coast of Europe, including the Netherlands. Constructed between 1942 and 1944, its primary purpose was to thwart allied invasions. The Dutch coastline featured numerous fortifications, bunkers, and artillery positions, reflecting the strategic importance of the region.

The map presents the whole listing of all dutch and german work, multiple types of complexes, command post, anti aircraft battery and anti-tank ditch.  Gathering all these information it is possible to read the settlements and the logic behind them, but most importantly the temporality of it, how these structures affected not only the existing cities and villages, but also the  future architectural defence and dune landscape within the time. See how they developed and how the city came back to its rightful place with the new bunkers still standing. Today, remnants of the Atlantic Wall serve as historical landmarks, reminding visitors of the countryâ€™s wartime history and the resilience of its people.
