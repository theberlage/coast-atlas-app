# The Atlantikwall

The Atlantic Wall was a defence line built by Nazi Germany during World War II, stretching along the western coast of Europe, including the Netherlands. Constructed between 1942 and 1944, its primary purpose was to thwart Allied invasions. The Dutch coastline featured numerous fortifications, bunkers, and artillery positions, reflecting the strategic importance of the region.
We will see in this presentation multiple types of bunkers, understand their settlements and the logic behind it, but most importantly the temporality of it, how it affected the existing an future architectural defence and dune landscape within the time. We will zoom in on three complexes that have specific military defences, see how they developed and how the city came back to its rightful place with the new bunkers still standing. Today, remnants of the Atlantic Wall serve as historical landmarks, reminding visitors of the country’s wartime history and the resilience of its people.
