# Batteries: Hoek van Holland to Katwijk

Multiple maps can be found that set all the complexes that structured the Atlantikwall. These complexes were strategically positioned to create overlapping fields of fire, complicating any potential assault, each of them had a purpose would it be major or minor to fortify the continuity of the defense line. 

Many of these fortifications were interconnected by underground tunnels, allowing for troop movement and supply transport. After World War II, multiple batteries stayed as a defence against the Cold War and the threats of a nuclear bomb, while others vanished under the sand or were demolished and destroyed. Some were used as emergency housing after the war. After the flood of 1953, multiple of these remaining bunkers and complexes got  destroyed for the preservation and safety of the dune landscape and the coastal integrity.
