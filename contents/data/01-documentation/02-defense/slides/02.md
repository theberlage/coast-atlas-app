# Batteries: Hoek van Holland to Katwijk

Looking through history we can find multiple maps that sets all the complexes that created the Atlantikwall, these complexes were strategically positioned to create overlapping fields of fire, complicating any potential assault. Each of them of them had a purpose would it be major or minor.

Many of these fortifications were interconnected by underground tunnels, allowing for troop movement and supply transport. After the second world war multiple batteries stayed as a defence against the Cold War and the threats of a nuclear bomb while others vanished under the sand or were demolished and destroyed, some were given as a emergency housing after the critical loss that created the war but after the flood of 1953 multiple of these standing bunkers and complexes got completely destroyed for the preservation and safety of the dune landscape and the coastal integrity.
