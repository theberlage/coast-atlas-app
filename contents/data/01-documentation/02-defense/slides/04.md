# Festung Hoek Van Holland

In a really small area of Hoek Van Holland, an extensive multiplication of the batteries and complexes. A defence web, securing the North Sea and the Nieuwe Waterweg, connected by the boulevard and the train railway for an efficient in-between communication and transport.

The complex defensive system was complemented by underground passages, and lookout points, allowing the German forces to monitor and control naval and land movements effectively. The bunkers were built following the Regelbau standards, which ensured quick and efficient construction.
