# Festung Hoek Van Holland

In the historical plan we can see the extensive multiplication of the batteries and complexes situated within a really small area of Hoek Van Holland. In this defence web, we will zoom into two complexes one called battery Vinetta, a huge central headquarters, and the complex KK that was securing the harbour in the in the Nieuwe Waterweg.
The complex defensive system was complemented by trenches, underground passages, and lookout points, allowing the German forces to monitor and control naval and land movements effectively. The bunkers were built following the Regelbau standard, which ensured quick and efficient construction.
