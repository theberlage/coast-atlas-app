# The Hague

The Hague played a crucial role in the Atlantikwall as a strategic coastal defence point in the Netherlands. Located at the entrance from the North Sea to the Nieuwe Waterweg, it was vital for controlling maritime traffic and protecting one of Germany's key logistical hubs. The area was fortified to deter invasions. Additionally, the beach and surrounding dunes were heavily fortified to resist amphibious assaults.                                                                                                                  

This 1951 map, uncover how the defense line affected the urban setting drastically, with tank walls, dragon’s tooth barriers, concrete scaffoldings, anti-tank ditch, and mines; all connected by a boulevard; creating a scarcity of housing with multiple families displaced.
