# Regelbau 622

Specifically designed as a casemate for coastal artillery, this bunker type typically housed a single heavy gun, such as a 105 mm or 150 mm artillery piece, which could be used against naval threats or ground targets. The structure features a thick concrete shell, offering substantial protection against aerial bombardment and artillery fire. The design includes slits for gun access and observation, as well as provisions for ammunition storage and crew accommodations. This bunker type was strategically located to cover vital coastal areas and shipping routes.
