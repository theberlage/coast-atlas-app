# Regelbau 622

Specifically designed for coastal artillery, this bunker type typically housed a single heavy gun, with thinner walls, which could be used against naval threats or ground targets. The structure features a thick concrete shell, offering substantial protection against aerial bombardment and artillery fire. The design includes slits for gun access and observation, as well as provisions for ammunition storage and crew accommodations. This bunker type was strategically located to cover vital coastal areas and shipping routes.

Constructed by the Germans in World War II, function from 1942 to 1945 as a  sleeping bunker, the advantage of this type of plan is to have two separate and independently protected rooms, each with their own heating system. A circulation corridor facilitates exit from the two rooms. Because of this, the 622 bunkers were kept intact and reused from 1947 as emergency housing.
