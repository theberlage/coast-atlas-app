# Dutch Dune Landscape

Treating about a third of its land below sea level, the Netherlands faces unique challenges in combating floods and rising sea levels. In this context, the dune landscape is crucial for coastal protection and also plays an important role as a productive landscape that serves various human needs. Examining the dune landscape evolution from 1860 to 1960 shows how humans appropriated this environment for many purposes such as infrastructure development, drinking water supply, and housing. Towns and villages emerged from the dunes while roads, railways and waterways improved access to the coastal areas. The natural filtration properties of dune sands facilitated the creation of systems for extracting clean drinking water, essential for growing urban populations. 

All this led to a significant transformation of the Dutch coastal landscape and the dunes evolved into multifunctional spaces illustrating how human ingenuity and natural processes intertwined to create a unique, productive environment.
