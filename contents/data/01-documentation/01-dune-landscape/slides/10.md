# Reclaiming and Rebuilding Ter Heijde 

After the war, there were  rumors that the municipal government had plans to turn Ter Heijde into a seaside resort. The villagers, desperate to be able to return and rebuild their village, wrote a seven pages petition reclaiming their rights and presenting arguments on the historic value of the village. After almost a year, the mayor declared that the reconstruction service would initiate a new plan for Ter Heijde.

On 19 December 1946, mayor KIJ Wouters unveiled a memorial stone in the facade of the first row of houses in Ter Heijde, which marked the beginning of the reconstruction of this walking village. The engraved stone read: “After Ter Heijde was swallowed up twice by the sea, it disappeared for the third time in 1943 by the all-destructive hand of the ruthless occupier. Now it will rise again for the fourth time, as this stone testifies.”
