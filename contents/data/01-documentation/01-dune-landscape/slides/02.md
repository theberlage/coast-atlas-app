# Coastal Protection

Dikes and breakwaters  are important elements of the coastal protection of the Netherlands. In history, dikes are one of the oldest structures built to prevent flooding. In the vulnerable area around Ter Heijde, different types of dikes can be found such as the M35 Slaperdijk constructed around 1826. These dikes delineate a very specific area called De Banken, two wet dune valleys that were formed by the act of two forces - land reclamation and sea erosion.

 In the nineteenth century, the breakwaters were constructed in phases along the entire Dutch coast, arranged at equal distances and numbered in sequence. These structures help to regulate the water flow around the entrances of ports to protect ships from waves and to prevent the dune landscape from being eroded by storms. Some of the breakwaters have now disappeared under the sand as a result of the construction of The Sand Motor.
