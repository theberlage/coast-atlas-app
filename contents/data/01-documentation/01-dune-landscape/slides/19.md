# Water tower in the dunes 

Functionally, the water tower in Scheveningen stores water and regulates water pressure. Water was transported through pipes to the cit﻿y center. Structurally, it was built with durable materials such as brick, natural stone, and steel to support the large water tanks. Standing at 48.74 meters tall, it was constructed to support the growing need for dune water extraction, with a storage capacity of 1,000 and 1,200 m³ in its two reservoirs. 

Architecturally, its façade, made of brick and partly natural stone, features vertical niches, block-patterned round-arched friezes, and rusticated corner pilasters adorned with sculpted Corinthian capitals. Notably, it is the first example in the Netherlands where the water reservoir was enclosed in a brick wall. The tower is crowned with a copper domed roof, giving it a distinctive silhouette
