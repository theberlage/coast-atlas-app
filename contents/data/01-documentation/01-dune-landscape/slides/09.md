# Post-War Development

In the late 1920s, because many houses in Ter Heijde were dilapidated, most of the village was demolished and rebuilt. When World War II broke out shortly after, the Germans commanded all houses to be demolished and the residents to be housed elsewhere, so they could have an open view on the North Sea. Only the church was allowed to remain. After the war, the village was rebuilt again.
