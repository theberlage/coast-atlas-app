# Stoomtramweg 

In 1897, the idea arose to develop the ports of Hoek van Holland and Scheveningen and connect them via a railway. In this way, goods, and eventually also people, could be easily transported between the two ports. However, the idea for the railway indicated on this plan between the port of Scheveningen and Hoek van Holland was never fully realized. 

In 1905, the tram line to Hoek van Holland was constructed from Loosduin and Monster with the goal of transporting people. The tram line was also used to transport locally produced vegetables and fruits to the port.
