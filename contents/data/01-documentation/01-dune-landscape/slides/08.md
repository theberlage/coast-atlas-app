# The Walking Village

Historically, the coastal defenses of the Netherlands were the weakest at the level of Ter Heijde. In some places, the entire defense consisted of just one row of dunes. For this reason, the coastal village has been continually eroded by storms over the past centuries. Four times, in 1470, 1530, 1546 and 1570, this village was destroyed by the waves. 

Usually, the houses threatened by the sea were demolished and rebuilt further inland. As the village was always moving, people sometimes called it the walking village. People have tried to counteract coastal erosion in all sorts of ways but this only really succeeded after stone dams were built in the sea in the nineteenth century.
