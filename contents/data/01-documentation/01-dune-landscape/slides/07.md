# Strandlijn

In 1906, plans were made to reinforce the coastline between Hoek van Holland and Kijkduin. By 1907, the Hoogheemraadschap Delfland began constructing the Strandlijn, a new railway line designed to transport materials for coastal reinforcement and ensure the maintenance of the seawall. The railway curved towards the dunes at the original Hoek van Holland station and continued along the beach and the duneâ€™s edge. The final section of the line, reaching Kijkduin, was completed in 1923.

Although the line was not used for bathers, it served a strategic role during World War II when German forces utilized it for building the Atlantikwall. After the war, most of the railway was dismantled, with only a small section near Hoek van Holland remaining for dune reinforcement work. The last train ran on the tracks in 1965, after which the line was gradually taken apart. Today, there are no visible remains of the railway line.
