# 1880: Hoek Van Holland 

Before the excavation of the Nieuwe Waterweg, the village of Hoek van Holland did not exist. The first building built there was the administrative office of the Rijkswaterstaat in 1867, which served as the headquarters for the excavation work on the Nieuwe Waterweg. Around this office, the workers involved in the project began to settle, creating the first settlement, known as De Oude Hoek.
