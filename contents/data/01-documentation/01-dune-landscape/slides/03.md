# Idea of the Nieuwe Waterweg

The excavation of the Nieuwe Waterweg was launched as part of a larger infrastructure plan to expand the Port of Rotterdam and improve maritime access. This new waterway provided a direct and more efficient route for ships traveling between Rotterdam, Hoek van Holland and the North Sea.

The project was conceived by civil engineer Pieter Caland, who proposed digging a straight canal through the dunes and marshlands at Hoek van Holland. This design greatly shortened and deepened the shipping canal, ensuring smoother and faster passage for vessels, thus transforming Rotterdam into a key European port.
