# Vertical Extraction Wells

After World War II, from 1945 to 1955, the mechanization of water extraction reached new heights. Deep wells were introduced to access water reserves at depths of 30 to 50 meters below sea level, and an intricate pipe network spread across the dunes. 

This period marked the introduction of more complex, vertical extraction wells in addition to the existing horizontal pipes. The process also became increasingly industrialized, marking a shift towards modern water extraction techniques that continue to shape the water infrastructure until today.
