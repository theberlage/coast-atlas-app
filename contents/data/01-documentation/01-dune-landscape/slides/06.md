# Hoek van Holland station

Hoek van Holland station was established during the construction of the Hoekse Lijn, serving as a place for storing goods transported between the railway and the Nieuwe Waterweg. 

Over the years, this station became an important infrastructural place in Hoek van Holland where several railroad lines such as the Hoekse Lijn and the Strandlijn converge with the harbor and the Nieuwe Waterweg. As a result, the station underwent many transformations, growing into an important storage place for goods but also playing an important role in the story of the coast as a recreational spot.
