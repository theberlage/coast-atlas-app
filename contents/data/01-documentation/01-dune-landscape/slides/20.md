# Development of the Pump Station

The pumping station underwent several stages of modernization. Following the installation of the first two balance machines in 1874, additional steam pumping equipment was introduced in 1882, 1894, and 1902. As the water network expanded, new boilers were also constructed to support these operations.

As the need for more storage space grew, the two oldest filters were rebuilt, with two concrete clear water reservoirs constructed below them, and two new filters installed above. These two reservoirs, with capacities of 3,000 m続 and 6,000 m続, were later expanded in 1918 with a third covered reservoir made of reinforced concrete. This additional reservoir increased the total storage capacity from 9,000 m続 to over 15,000 m続, which was five times the average hourly water usage at that time.
