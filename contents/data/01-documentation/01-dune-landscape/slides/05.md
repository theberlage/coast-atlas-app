# Hoekse Lijn

The railway line from Schiedam to Hoek van Holland, established in 1893, was built as a consequence of the development of the Nieuwe Waterweg. It was originally built for transporting goods between the harbors, but over time it was adapted for passenger use as well, becoming a vital link between Rotterdam and the coast.

The railway is built on a specially constructed dike, therefore it also functions as an additional protection against floods.
